        <h3>It Begins with....</h3>
        <p>
          The demons of the Burning Hells have long desired to invade the realm of men. To this end, a powerful group
          of demon lords known as the Lesser Evils exiled their brethren, the Prime Evils, from the Hells and sent
          them to the human world of Sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          War came with them. The Prime Evils—Diablo, Mephisto, and Baal—began corrupting humans, twisting them into
          dark servants, and poisoning their minds with false promises of power and wealth. They planned to use these
          souls in their ongoing battle against the angels of the High Heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brave heroes banded together and managed to slay the Prime Evils, though the demons’ influence left parts
          of the world scarred and broken. Thousands of people perished, towns were burned to ash, and an entire
          nation fell to ruin when the Worldstone was destroyed. This ancient relic once kept Sanctuary safe from the
          armies of demons and angels, but it has been shattered, and its protection is no more.

        <p>
          Today, few survivors tell tales of the Prime Evils, and many people on Sanctuary are unaware that the
          Worldstone ever existed. They remain ignorant of the growing danger that the Worldstone’s absence places
          them in, content to till their fields and sell their wares in relative peace. But those who saw the Prime
          Evils’ devastation firsthand remember that two of the Lesser Evils yet live in the Burning Hells…Azmodan,
          the Lord of Sin, and Belial, the Lord of Lies. These great demons have not forgotten the world of
          Sanctuary—indeed, they see a chance to seize it for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a star has fallen from the heavens—a grim omen that heralds the End of Days. Sanctuary’s frightened
          inhabitants are turning to abandoned legends and prophecies for answers. They have no hope against a full
          onslaught from the Burning Hells. The heroes of the past are gone or dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new champion must rise…
