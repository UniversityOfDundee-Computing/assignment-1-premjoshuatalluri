        <h1>ACTION BAR</h1>
        <p>The <b>action bar</b> is a visual representation of your hero’s health, active skills, class resource, and
          other vital information.</p>
        <p>On your screen, you’ll see a bar made up of small icons. This is your action bar. The action bar contains
          your active skills, class-specific powers that help you slay demons faster or stay alive longer. It also
          displays powerful limited-use items; specifically, healing potions. Using these abilities and items carefully
          can mean the difference between life and death in tough battles. During multiplayer games, additional action
          bars will show up on your screen so that you can monitor the status of your allies.</p>
        <p>The action bar will also display any positive effects (buffs) and detrimental effects (debuffs) currently on
          your character, as well as their remaining duration. Buffs gained through your own skills will display their
          remaining duration with a green bar along the top of the skill’s icon, while buffs gained through passives,
          fellow party members, or items which display along the top left of the action bar. Debuffs will be shown on
          the top right.</p>

        <h1>DIFFICULTY LEVELS</h1>
        <p>
          Diablo III is not over when you finish its final Act. You might want a tougher (or easier) experience; to that
          end, you can choose the difficulty of your game in the Game Settings menu. Increased difficulty means hardier,
          more deadly monsters and increased rewards like more gold and experience. As you complete certain milestones,
          you’ll unlock even more difficulty levels with which you can continue the game, modes with names like
          <b>Master</b> or <b>Torment</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your hero’s levels, skills, powers, and equipment will persist when you switch between difficulty levels.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the Torment difficulty setting, you will also find unique, legendary armor and weapons that are only
        available in that difficulty level. As you grow in power, so too will your enemies.

        <h1>HARDCORE CHARACTERS</h1>
        <p>When creating a new hero on the character creation page, you can choose to create a hardcore character.
          Hardcore characters differ from "normal" characters in only one crucial area:</p>
        <p><b>IF YOUR HARDCORE CHARACTER DIES, THAT CHARACTER IS PERMANENTLY DEAD</b>. They will never be playable
          again. There is only one way to successfully play a hardcore character: don’t die.</p>
        <p>Hardcore characters can only share the items in their stash with your other hardcore characters. They are not
          recommended for the faint of heart.</p>

        <h1>Dealing Damage</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="damage-container-1 d-flex">
        <div class="flex-fill">
          <p>Use an offensive skill repeatedly on your foes, and you’ll notice it won’t always deal the same amount of
            damage. Every time you use an offensive skill, it randomly draws a number from your equipped weapon’s Damage
            range, which is then modified by your skill’s damage multiplier. For instance, if your weapon’s damage range
            is 1–10 and you use an ability that deals 200% weapon damage, you’ll deal anywhere from 2–20 damage.</p>
          <p>The Attacks per Second value on a weapon shows how fast it can attack. The majority of your skills will
            resolve faster when used with speedier weapons, such as daggers. Slower weapons, like two-handed axes,
            typically have higher damage ranges.</p>
          <p>A weapon’s Damage per Second value represents its overall potential, taking into account both damage and
            speed. Experiment with various weapon and skill combinations to discover your preferred combat style!</p>

        <h2>DAMAGE TYPES</h2>
        <p>An active damage skill always delivers its payload using a single damage type, and many rune variants can
          change the resulting type completely. When you select a skill, you can see what kind of damage it deals. Keep
          this in mind if you come across ítems that increase the effectiveness of a particular element. Regardless of
          the element on your equipped weapon, the skills you choose will determine the damage types you’ll unleash on
          the minions of the Burning Hells.</p>
        <div class="damage-elements d-flex justify-content-center">
          <img src="images/elements.jpg" alt="damage elements">
        </div>
        <p class="g1-p">Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison, Arcane, Holy</p>
        <div>
          <ol style="list-style: disc;">
            <li><b class="list-head">Physical:</b> A myriad of skills that harm enemies in conventional ways, such as the Barbarian’s Bash or the
              Demon Hunter’s Impale, are classified as Physical. As you grow in power, several of your Physical
              abilities will gain new runes that change their damage type while providing added effects. Abilities and
              runes that don’t actively deal damage (such as the Crusader’s Laws of Justice and its variations) are also
              classified as Physical, but their effects are not increased by added Physical damage on your equipment.
            </li>
            <li><b class="list-head">Fire:</b> Skills that deal Fire damage typically offer up unrivaled offense at the cost of utility. Massive
              offensive bonuses, additional damage over time, and increased resource generation fuel the searing
              destruction of your enemies.
            <li><b class="list-head">Cold:</b> Many Cold damage skills slow or freeze your enemies; others leave them vulnerable to additional
              damage while they are chilled or frozen.
            </li>
            <li> <b class="list-head">Lightning:</b> The Lightning damage variants of some abilities can stun targets, increase the number of
              enemies affected, or reduce resource costs and cooldowns for greater efficiency in combat.
            </li>
            <li> <b class="list-head">Poison:</b> Vile afflictions dealt by Poison type abilities weaken enemies, damaging them over time and
              reducing their effectiveness in combat. Many of the Witch Doctor’s offensive skills fall under this damage
              type.
            </li>
            <li> <b class="list-head">Arcane:</b> Abilities that rapidly disintegrate enemies with raw magical power and elemental forces of
              nature fit this damage type. Several of the Wizard’s offensive skills deal Arcane damage.
            </li>
            <li> <b class="list-head">Holy:</b> On top of dealing damage, the offensive powers of holy magic employed in battle by Crusaders and
              Monks can disrupt enemy behavior or provide defensive bonuses.</li>
